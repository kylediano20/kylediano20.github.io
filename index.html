    <h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
    <p>I worked really hard to create this website. The goal of it is to showcase my HTML skills and talk about CSCE 432. </p>

    <!-- Sections with Headings -->
    <h2>Why did I Choose CSCE 432</h2>
    <p>I chose this class because accessibility is an important topic in the world of software engineering. I am a firm believer in inclusion and equality, and it is a big deal
    in software because software can impact millions of people at a time.</p>

    <h2>My course experience</h2>
    <p>Before taking this class, I had experience with CSCE 121, 221, 411, 410, 412, 315, and many more classes that prepared me for this one. The most applicable class I had
    was CSCE 315, where we had to design a website with accessibility in mind. I have attached a link below to the TAMU CSCE course catalog to view these courses.</p>
